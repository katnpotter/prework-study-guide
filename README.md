# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The study guide serves as a tutorial of the foundational tools I'll be learning and be using the most both in the upcoming bootcamp and in the professional world. It holds important definitions, commands, and information that I may need to refer to many times throughout my coursework. While building the study guide I was able to learn how to understand, read, and write HTML, CSS, JS, and use git commands.

## Usage

The study guide offers useful commands and terms for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and has sections filled with lists of information on each topic learned throughout the Prework course. The Chrome DevTools console can be opened to show JavaScript functionality. JavaScript will choose a random topic from the list to be studied.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
