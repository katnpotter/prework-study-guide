        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
     <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
     <li>An element is everything between an opening and closing tag.</li>
     <li>A tag is contained inside angle brackets.</li>
     <li>Common elements used are: text, image, header, and list elements.</li>
     <li>Semantic elements are an example of body elements and they are used to describe its content and its role.</li>
     <li>Semantic elements make the website more accessible and the HTML easier to read.</li>
    <li>An attribute is additional information about an element.</li>
    <li>The doctype declaration tells the browser what type of document to expect when opened.</li>
    <li>Declarations are not case sensitive but elements are.</li>
    <li>Headings should be used in order of size and the largest heading should only appear once.</li>
    <li>The body element is known as a parent element and the ones on the inside are called child elements.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Three ways to style a webpage are with inline CSS, and internal and external 
            style sheets.</li>
            <li>Inline CSS is a way to style an element directly, or independently.</li>
            <li>Internal style sheets are contained inside the head section and are 
              applied to multiple elements.</li>
              <li>External style sheets are all CSS rules of a document kept in a linked
                file in the head section.</li>
                <li>Declarations contain the property and the value of the property.</li>
            <li>The Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code is a coding principle that 
              encourages you to reuse or share pieces of code reduce the amount
              that needs to be rewritten.</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git push origin branch name: pushes all changes of that branch to the remote repository</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls all changes from the remote branch to the local branch</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of a line is where a statement ends.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
          <li>Boolean is a true or false value. They are special keywords that 
            do not need quotations.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is a weakly typed language.</li>
            <li>Strings are all surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
            <li>In JavaScript, code runs linear from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>Conditional statements and loops control the order that code is executed
              or if it is at all.</li>
              <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision making into code.</li>
              <li>If statements only execute if the statement meets a condition or if it is true.</li>
              <li>When a computer encounters an if statement it will check to see if it is truthy or falsy.</li>
              <li>Falsy values include null, undefined, 0, and NaN (Not a Number).</li>
              <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
              <li>The first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.</li>
              <li>A 'for' loop uses the pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in 
                an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
                <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language.</li>
                <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a 
                  certain task.</li>
                  <li>Functions have to be called in order to be executed.</li>
                  <li>A function's name is followed by parenthesis.</li>
